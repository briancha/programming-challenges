# Programming Challenges
* Calculate Collection: extracts a collection of numbers from a list whose sum is a specific number
* Convert Decimal to Octal: takes in a decimal number and converts it to octal form (base 8)
* Create 2 Equal Groups: creates 2 sets of numbers with the smallest difference in values from 1 set of numbers
* Exponentiation: Java doesn't use the caret (^) for exponents, so I created my own method
* Find Palindromes: takes in 2 numbers, and prints out the numbers between them that are palindromes
* Operating Systems (C): projects for Operating Systems class. Written in C.
* PlusMinus: For a list of positive integers, see if it is possible to insert plus or minus signs in front of each positive integer in the list, so that the result equals a positive integer in that list. Contains Java and Scheme implementations.
* Print Next Highest Octal Number: takes in an octal number with 8 different digits and prints out the next highest octal number with 8 different digits
* Time Clock: allows employees to clock in and clock out using their own 4-digit PIN. More info: https://www.brianchan.me/time-clock.html
* Valid Parentheses: checks a certain set of parentheses, i.e. ((())()), and returns the number of parentheses pairs there are
